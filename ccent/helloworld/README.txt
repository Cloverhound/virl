Aw your first lab. How cute.

The goal of this lab is to be able to ping between server-1 and server-2, and then to be able to ping between the router and the two servers.

Username and password for the servers is cisco/cisco. Ignore the management network as it will work by default.

Here's some questions to help you think through everything:

1. What interfaces are used between devices? Should be in the diagram.
2. What is the IP and mask of each of the servers? Do these need to change?
3. What is the command to show the running configuration on IOS?
4. What is the command to save the running configuration?
5. What is the command to show interfaces on the router/switch? What about on the servers?
6. What is the command to look at the arp table on both the servers and the router?
7. What is the command to look at the routing table on the servers and the router?
8. Does the switch need to have IP addresses assigned to the ports? Why or why not?
9. What VLAN are the ports in? Will this work?
