Aw your first lab. How cute.

The goal of this lab is to be able to ping between server-1 and server-2, and then to be able to ping between the router and the two servers.

Here's some general notes:

1. Everything is in the 10.0.0.0/8 subnet.
2. Username and password for the servers is cisco/cisco.
